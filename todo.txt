Chicken App todo:

Higher priority:
- When renaming observation before saving, change session itself? At least change statistics name.
- Append version number to end of statistics if conflicting name with existing file.
- Allow multiple active state behaviours by storing the active state on each behaviour along with a timer.

Lower priority:
- Move calculation of statistics to somewhere nicer (possibly create a Statistics object)
- Change package name.
